# AlgoTradeBacktester
Description: Backtester for price action trading algorithms
The main component of this repo is the StrategySuite.py file. The other files are simple examples of how the suite can be utilized.

### IMPORTANT: The Tester class connects to the MT5 terminal which is only available on Windows. So, this code won't work on UNIX based systems :(

### IMPORTANT: Open your MT5 terminal and change the max history of bars to unlimited to for the code to work as intended.
